Murowana Goślina is a small town located about 20 km from Poznań. Town has a surface 7,15 km2 also population 10 000 people. Murowana Goślina has its charm and potential industrial. It is close Poznań with good comunication, so companies decided here building factory. It has been planned so that they do not disturb residents. Factory are build on your own street called Przemysłowa. History about rise a town is a simple. Foreign knight Gostl received the land, which called Górka and later Goślina. Because of the town's appearance residents divided Murowana Goślina into two districts: Zielone Wzgórza and Stara Murowana.</h3>

When i called to people, often heard negative opinions about me. I was involved in calling individuals and offering them products. Second job was warehouseman, my task was a order picking. That's when I decided to study logistics. Work is dynamic, but also peaceful. During the picking you had to carry goods that weighed from 1 kg to 30 kg. Last job was machine operator. It was be a new for me. I studied about year, to be able to handle machine yourself. Work with an emphasis on production. The machine could never stand without a serious reason. My task was to operate machines and its maintenance. I used to work an overhead crane and a forklift. The employee had to be focused all the time.</h3>
